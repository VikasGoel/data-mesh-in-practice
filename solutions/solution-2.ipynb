        "In this exercise we want to experience the effort it takes to provide a good description of a dataset as the data producer. To achieve that, we are looking at how our example dataset \"Order Positions\" is generated. Following that, we ask you to first provide a schema definition for our dataset and aftewards provide a free text description of the same. Please keep in mind all the issues we faced and discussed before and how the schema or the description could help pointing those out.\n",
